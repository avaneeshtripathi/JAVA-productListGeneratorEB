We have a csv file that looks like this



Id,	Vendor,		Product Name,			Product Code,	Unit,	Weight,	Price

1,	Vendor1,	Coriander Leaves (April-Nov),	3736,		Kg,	3,	90

2,	Vendor1,	Mint Leaves 500 Gm,		4371,		Grams,	500,	27.5
3,	Vendor1,	Ginger 500 Gm,			4356,		Grams,	500,	29.5

4,	Vendor1,	Lemon 500 Gm,			4365,		Grams,	500,	32.5

5,	Vendor2,	Coriander Leaves (April-Nov),	3736,		Kg,	3,	80

6,	Vendor2,	Mint Leaves 500 Gm,		4371,		Grams,	500,	27.5

7,	Vendor2,	Ginger 500 Gm,			4356,		Grams,	500,	30

8,	Vendor2,	Lemon 500 Gm,			4365,		Grams,	500,	31

9,	Vendor3,	Coriander Leaves (April-Nov),	3736,		Kg,	3,	88

10,	Vendor3,	Mint Leaves 500 Gm,		4371,		Grams,	500,	27.3

11,	Vendor3,	Ginger 500 Gm,			4356,		Grams,	500,	29.7

12,	Vendor3,	Lemon 500 Gm,			4365,		Grams,	500,	34.5

i.e., product list from multiple vendors and their price offerrings

.

Unfortunately, the file is consolidated and we need a better way to extract useful information.
 We would like to be able to generate a product list based on:

	- cheapest prices

	- expensive prices
	- get cheapest or expensive price list only for given product IDs



For example, for cheapest prices, we would get a list like:


3,	Vendor1,	Ginger 500 Gm,			4356,		Grams,	500,	29.5

5,	Vendor2,	Coriander Leaves (April-Nov),	3736,		Kg,	3,	80

8,	Vendor2,	Lemon 500 Gm,			4365,		Grams,	500,	31
10,	Vendor3,	Mint Leaves 500 Gm,		4371,		Grams,	500,	27.3




- You can do this in any language, Python,PHP or Golang preferred

- Assumptions should be justified when submitting your solution

- A simple script would do, doesn't have to be a GUI or Webapp

- When we run your solution, make sure it prints 3 lists on stdout:

	- cheapest prices

	- expensive prices

	- cheapest prices for products [3736, 4356, 3732, 3746, 3759, 3719, 3740, 4341]


- You should provide clear instructions to run your solution



Some other information:

	
- thoughtful architecture of code. **It should be scalable, easily extensible.**

	- documentation and comments

	- tests! tests! tests!

	- it would be great if you could make use of object oriented paradigms.


- through this challenge, apart from the correct outputs, we are also looking to evaluate how you come to build the architecture and your problem-solving capabilities.


- **please think through your solution carefully. We're looking for good architecture and overall extensibility.**
